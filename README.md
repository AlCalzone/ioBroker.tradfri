=================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AlCalzone/iobroker.tradfri.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AlCalzone/iobroker.tradfri)

## Installation on Raspberry PI
Installation tested on Linux and MacOS with NodeJS >= 6. NodeJS 4 support is in the works.

Requires a TrÃ¥dfri gateway in your home network.

0. Make sure you have git installed. If not: `sudo apt-get git-core`
1. Install this adapter via the ioBroker GUI -> This will result in an error
2. Open the console and navigate to `/opt/iobroker/node_modules/iobroker.tradfri`
3. There, run `sudo npm install --production --unsafe-perm`, this will take a while.
4. If neccessary, add an adapter instance, then configure it by entering the IP/hostname of your gateway and the security code that can be found under that.
